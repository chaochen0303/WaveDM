# WaveDM


WaveDM is a python code for the 3D simulation of the formation and mergers of Wave Dark Matter (WDM) soliton.

WaveDM is a modified version based on PyUltraLight (https://github.com/auckland-cosmo/PyUltraLight; https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.04037).

### Contents
- `SolitonMY.py`: The core of the code, including the solver of WDM dynamics and box construction in k and x space;
- `Output_Videos`: The output of the video of WDM soliton formation or merger;
- `Soliton_Simulation.ipynb`: The jupyter notebook for the input.

### Getting started
To run the jupyter notebook `Soliton_Simulation.ipynb`.

### Dependencies
The code is compatible with Python3. More detailed dependencies can be found in `Simulation.ipynb`.
